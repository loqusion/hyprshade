## Description

Hyprshade takes full advantage of Hyprland's `decoration:screen_shader` feature
by automating the process of switching screen shaders, either from a user-defined
schedule or on the fly. It can be used as a replacement[^1] for apps that adjust
the screen's color temperature such as [f.lux](https://justgetflux.com/),
[redshift](http://jonls.dk/redshift/), or [gammastep](https://gitlab.com/chinstrap/gammastep)
with `blue-light-filter`, which is installed by default.

[^1]: Gradual color shifting currently unsupported.

## Installation

### Arch Linux

Use your favorite AUR helper (e.g. [paru](https://github.com/Morganamilo/paru)):

```sh
paru -S hyprshade
```

Or manually:

```sh
sudo pacman -S --needed base-devel
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/hyprshade.git
cd hyprshade
makepkg -si
```

### PyPI

If your distribution isn't officially supported, you can also install directly
from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/hyprshade/) with
[pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/)[^2]:

```sh
pipx install hyprshade
```

[^2]: Installing with `pip` outside of a venv is unsupported.

## Usage

```text
Usage: hyprshade [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

Commands:
  auto     Set screen shader on schedule
  current  Print current screen shader
  install  Install systemd user units
  ls       List available screen shaders
  off      Turn off screen shader
  on       Turn on screen shader
  toggle   Toggle screen shader
```

Commands which take a shader name accept either the basename:

```sh
hyprshade on blue-light-filter
```

...or a full path name:

```sh
hyprshade on ~/.config/hypr/shaders/blue-light-filter.glsl
```

If you provide the basename, Hyprshade searches in `~/.config/hypr/shaders` and `/usr/share/hyprshade`.

### Scheduling

> [!WARNING]
> For scheduling to work, `systemd --user` must have access to the environment variable
> `HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE`.
>
> Add the following line to `hyprland.conf`[^3]:
>
> ```hypr
> exec-once = dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd HYPRLAND_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE
> ```
>

To have specific shaders enabled during certain periods of the day, you can
create a config file in either `~/.config/hypr/hyprshade.toml` or `~/.config/hyprshade/config.toml`.

```toml
[[shades]]
name = "vibrance"
default = true  # will be activated when no other shader is scheduled

[[shades]]
name = "blue-light-filter"
start_time = 19:00:00
end_time = 06:00:00   # optional if more than one shader has start_time
```

For starters, you can copy the example config:

```sh
cp /usr/share/hyprshade/examples/config.toml ~/.config/hypr/hyprshade.toml
```

After writing your config, install the systemd timer/service [user units][systemd-user-units] and enable
the timer unit:

[systemd-user-units]: https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Systemd/User

```sh
hyprshade install
systemctl --user enable --now hyprshade.timer
```

> [!TIP]
> Run `hyprshade install` every time you make changes to `hyprshade.toml` to keep the user units in sync.

### Tips

You probably want the following line in your `hyprland.conf`:

```hypr
exec = hyprshade auto
```

This ensures that the correct shader is enabled when you log in.

## FAQ

### How do I dismiss error messages from Hyprland?

[`hyprctl seterror disable`]. (Contrary to what the command may seem to imply,
this does _not_ disable any further error messages.) You may also use
[`hyprctl reload`].

[`hyprctl reload`]: https://wiki.hyprland.org/Configuring/Using-hyprctl/#reload

<!-- markdownlint-disable line-length -->

### I tried to copy something from the `examples/` or `shaders/` directory, but it's not working. What gives?

<!-- markdownlint-enable line-length -->

TL;DR: Hyprshade should work properly without needing to manually copy files.
If activating a shader with `hyprshade on` does not work out of the box, feel
free to [open a bug report].

If you try to copy things from the `main` branch while you are using a stable
release, it may not work properly. This repository has a single-branch
development scheme, where all development is done on the `main` branch and
stable versions are [pinned with
tags](https://github.com/loqusion/hyprshade/tags). The only exception to this is
that updates to the README pertaining to unreleased features are kept on
separate branches to avoid advertising features not present in any stable
version.

If you'd like to try out unreleased features, you can use a development version
of Hyprshade â€” currently, the only officially supported way to do this is to use
the [`hyprshade-git` AUR
package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/hyprshade-git).
